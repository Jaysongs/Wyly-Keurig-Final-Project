https://in-info-web4.luddy.indianapolis.iu.edu/~jlwyly/Wyly%20Keurig/dist/

This project is a web-based storefront designed to replicate the shopping experience of the Keurig website. It allows users to explore a range of coffee makers, pods, and accessories while highlighting special offers and personalized options.

## Overview

The website features a clean and intuitive interface, starting with a header that provides easy access to essential navigation links, including categories like Coffee Makers, Beverages, Accessories, and Subscriptions. A prominently placed search bar ensures users can quickly find specific products, while a shopping cart icon tracks items added to their cart.

Promotions are a central focus of the website. Visitors are greeted with banners showcasing discounts such as "2 FREE BOXES - BREW2FREE" or "45% OFF SITEWIDE." These promotional elements include call-to-action buttons that guide users to relevant product pages or deals.

## Product Display

Each product is presented with a high-quality image, a detailed name, and pricing information. Promotions or discounts, like "30% OFF - SMARTBREW30," are highlighted directly on the product cards, making it easy for users to identify deals. A rating system is integrated into the product details to help users make informed decisions. Below each product, an "Add to Cart" button is available for quick shopping.

## Personalization and Subscriptions

The website emphasizes customization by offering starter kits that allow users to select their preferred coffee maker and pods. Subscription options are also available, enabling customers to enjoy regular deliveries of coffee pods at discounted rates. These features cater to coffee enthusiasts seeking a seamless and personalized experience.

## Footer and Support

The footer includes essential links, such as About Us, Contact Us, FAQs, and Terms of Service. Social media icons provide direct access to the brand’s online presence, encouraging user engagement beyond the website. Support resources are also available to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive and responsive user interface. Additional frameworks or libraries may be integrated for enhanced functionality, such as React for dynamic components or Bootstrap for layout styling.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include integrating a payment gateway for real-time transactions, implementing a user login system for account management, and adding product reviews and ratings from real customers.
